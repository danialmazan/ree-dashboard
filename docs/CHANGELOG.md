# Changelog

## 2026-09-09

- Rebuilt the project as REE Dashboard with a static Grid Monitor interface, complete EN/ES UI, real REData monthly generation/demand/capacity/carbon-context data, an OMIE price adapter, strict provenance/validation, token-safe e·sios configuration, and GitHub Pages deployment at `/ree-dashboard/`.
- Removed the obsolete FastAPI runtime and all synthetic generators; hourly sections now report the missing e·sios token instead of showing invented values.
- Files changed: source/validation scripts, generated public data, frontend, tests, Pages workflow, README, and runbook.
- Reproduce: run `npm run data:fetch`, `npm run data:validate`, `python3 -m pytest tests`, and `npm run build`; inspect EN/ES at desktop and 390px.

## 2026-03-27

- Fixed the interconnector split chart so export bars use their own negative stack instead of sharing the import stack, which makes exports render from zero down to their full absolute magnitude rather than collapsing toward the net line.
- Files changed: `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `npm run build`, open the interconnectors page in `Imports / exports` mode, and verify that a month like `2022-10` shows France near `+79` for imports, `-286` for exports, and the white net line near `-207`.

- Fixed the interconnector split-mode tooltip so export series are displayed as absolute values while still rendering below zero on the chart, which avoids reading export magnitudes as negative net values.
- Files changed: `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `npm run build`, open the interconnectors page in `Imports / exports` mode, and hover a month with exports to confirm the tooltip shows export magnitudes without a minus sign.

- Extended the synthetic hourly sample store so coverage and marginal-technology data now span 2019-01 through 2026-03 instead of only a short 2024-2025 window, and updated the dashboard copy/docs to match.
- Files changed: `backend/app/sample_store.py`, `backend/app/repository.py`, `backend/tests/test_api.py`, `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `README.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `python3 scripts/build_sample_store.py`, `./backend/.venv/bin/pytest`, `npm run build`, then query coverage or marginal technology for 2019 and 2026 months in the dashboard.

- Widened the generation-page balance chart plus the system-page capacity and emissions cards, stopped rendering out-of-window coverage months as fake zero bars, added explicit sample-data availability notes, and made sample interconnector imports/exports more realistic than a direct transform of net balance.
- Files changed: `backend/app/sample_store.py`, `backend/tests/test_api.py`, `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `frontend/src/styles.css`, `README.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `python3 scripts/build_sample_store.py`, `./backend/.venv/bin/pytest`, `npm run build`, then restart the dashboard and inspect the generation, interconnectors, coverage, marginal, and system pages.

## 2026-03-25

- Implemented the first Spain electricity dashboard MVP scaffold with a FastAPI backend, generated local analytics store, React/Vite frontend shell, and repo run documentation.
- Files changed: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `scripts/build_sample_store.py`, `README.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Reproduce: install backend/frontend dependencies, run `python3 scripts/build_sample_store.py`, start `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`, then `npm run dev`.

## 2026-03-26

- Added a repo-root `package.json` so `npm run dev` and `npm run build` work from the project root by forwarding to the frontend app.
- Files changed: `package.json`, `README.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: from the repo root run `npm run dev` or `npm run build`.

- Added frontend API error handling so the dashboard shows a visible backend-start message instead of hanging on "Loading local analytics store…", and added a repo-root `npm run api:dev` script.
- Files changed: `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `frontend/src/styles.css`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: stop the backend, load the frontend, and confirm the error state appears; then run `npm run api:dev`.

- Fixed the `/api/exchanges` monthly net path so interconnector requests return `value_gwh` instead of crashing with `KeyError: 'net_imports_gwh'`, and added a regression test for that endpoint.
- Files changed: `backend/app/repository.py`, `backend/tests/test_api.py`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `./backend/.venv/bin/pytest`, then start the API and load the dashboard with the interconnectors panel requesting `direction=net`.

- Restructured the dashboard into page-based sections, added top-level month-range filtering, converted the national mix to monthly stacked bars / 12-month averages, changed marginal technology to monthly percentage shares, removed the right-side panel, and updated chart formatting and capacity bars.
- Files changed: `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `frontend/src/api.ts`, `frontend/src/styles.css`, `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/repository.py`, `backend/tests/test_api.py`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `./backend/.venv/bin/pytest`, run `npm run build`, then open the app with `npm run dev` and `npm run api:dev`.

- Split page-specific source selectors so generation and coverage no longer share the same selection state, moved the generation selector into the generation chart block, and corrected the 12-month mode to use monthly data with a rolling 12-month average instead of annual backend totals.
- Files changed: `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `npm run build`, open the app, compare source selections across pages, and switch the main chart between `Monthly` and `12M average`.

- Refined page-specific controls and semantics: signed import-gap bars in the balance chart, interconnector `Net` vs `Imports / exports` modes with country multi-select and net total line, indexed capacity vs generation chart on the generation page, percentage-based coverage breakdowns, fixed marginal-tech stack/axis behavior, and higher-precision CO2 intensity labels.
- Files changed: `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `./backend/.venv/bin/pytest`, run `npm run build`, then inspect the generation, interconnectors, coverage, marginal, and system pages in the browser.

- Added a single-command local launcher so the dashboard can be started from one terminal with `npm start`, which runs both the backend and frontend and shuts both down on `Ctrl+C`.
- Files changed: `scripts/dev.mjs`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: from the repo root run `npm start`.

- Split date filters by page, fixed the generation trend and balance chart semantics, added generation-family presets plus an independent capacity selector, changed coverage threshold updates to explicit apply, separated system context into two sections, and varied interconnector country shares by month in the sample store.
- Files changed: `backend/app/sample_store.py`, `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `frontend/src/styles.css`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `python3 scripts/build_sample_store.py`, `./backend/.venv/bin/pytest`, `npm run build`, then refresh the app.

- Extended the monthly sample store through March 2026, made monthly net imports vary materially so balance/interconnector charts are not flat, updated default page ranges to `2019-01` through `2026-03`, removed the capacity-generation index chart, widened the selected-source trend chart, padded the coverage timeline to the selected range, and increased chart margins / emissions-axis width to prevent clipped labels.
- Files changed: `backend/app/sample_store.py`, `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `frontend/src/styles.css`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Reproduce: run `python3 scripts/build_sample_store.py`, `./backend/.venv/bin/pytest`, `npm run build`, then restart the app.
