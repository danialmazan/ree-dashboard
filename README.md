# REE Dashboard

An English/Spanish static dashboard for exploring Spain's measured electricity generation, demand, installed capacity, carbon-emitting generation share, cross-border flows, and day-ahead market context.

Production URL: <https://danielalmazan.com/ree-dashboard/>

## Data policy

- Monthly generation, demand, capacity, and CO2-equivalent classification come from the public REData API.
- Day-ahead Spanish prices come from OMIE's public `MARGINALPDBC` files.
- Hourly generation, demand, and border exchanges require a personal e·sios token. Request one from `consultasios@ree.es` and expose it only as `ESIOS_TOKEN` locally or in GitHub Actions.
- Marginal price-setting technology is never classified after 18 March 2025 because OMIE states that the new bid typology prevents identification after that date.
- Missing data stays missing. The project contains no synthetic-data generator or fallback.

Raw downloads are cached under gitignored `data/raw/`. The browser reads compact validated assets from `frontend/public/data/` and requires no production server.
